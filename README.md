# WebSearcher
A python websearcher using Selenium 

This program uses selenium to srap search results from search engines.

## Update

The google and duckduckgo grabbers do not work anymore, but the bing one works. I am working on a fix.

## Requirments

Python3
Selenium

Add Chromedriver to $PATH

## Usage

Change the variable "searchstring" in the starting of each file and run it.
It will get you the search results in a csv file named "<SeachEngine>links.csv"

It will give you all the links that can be provided by the search engines.
